# Formula One Race Lap-by-Lap Prediction with Machine Learning

[webpage](./images/2021_sakhir.png)

This website features two machine learning models that can predict lap times, positions, pit stop strategies as well as events like collisions for up to 20 drivers throughout a whole race.

Other features:
- 2 models to choose from. One trained with 20 years of data, the other trained with historical pit stop data.
- Interactive slider to look at lap times, statuses, etc of any lap during the race.
- Colorful graph to easily grasp drivers' positions through out the race.

- 20 years of historical data to predict what could have happened. Using the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/), you can choose from any race since 2001 and let the model envision an alternate ending.
- Randomness factor to add unlimited possibilities.


Some predictions made by the models:
- This is a prediction on the 2021 Imola Grand Prix. While the model could not accurately predict crashes, the results are sensible.

- Some predictions are quite far off reality. This is a prediction on a 2020 race. The model predicted that Hass would have two drivers on the podium.

- With a lot of added randomness, the model gives very eventful races.
